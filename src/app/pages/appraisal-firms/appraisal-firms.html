    <h2>What Choosing the Right or Wrong Appraisal Firm Does to Your Deal</h2>
    <p>Choosing the right appraisal firm directly affects financing approvals, negotiations, and long-term strategy. A skilled appraiser understands Calgary's micro-markets, sale trends, rental dynamics, and lender expectations. For homeowners, this often means fewer surprises and smoother approvals.</p>
    <p>For investors, the stakes are even higher. An inaccurate valuation can distort cashflow, cap-rate analysis, and ROI projections. In Calgary—where neighbourhood-level differences matter—your appraiser must think like an investor and risk analyst, not just a box-checker. A strong appraisal supports your strategy; a weak one can derail it.</p>

      <h3>⚠️ The Risk of Poor Appraisal</h3>
      <p>A weak or inaccurate appraisal can lead to denied financing, overpaying for properties, poor investment decisions, and legal complications. The right appraisal firm is an essential partner in any real estate transaction.</p>
