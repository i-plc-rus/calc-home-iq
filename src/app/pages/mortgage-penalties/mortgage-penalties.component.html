        <p class="lead">If you break a fixed-rate mortgage in Canada, your penalty is almost never what you expect. Many homeowners believe the penalty is three months' interest. In reality, for most fixed-rate mortgages, the penalty is calculated using a formula that can result in $10,000–$40,000+ charges — sometimes even higher.</p>
        
        <p>This guide explains exactly how mortgage penalties are calculated, shows real-world examples from trusted news articles, and helps Alberta homeowners avoid expensive surprises.</p>
        
        <div class="important-note">
            <p><strong>Key takeaway:</strong> When you break a fixed-rate mortgage, lenders charge the greater of three months' interest OR Interest Rate Differential (IRD). For big banks, IRD almost always applies on fixed-rate mortgages.</p>

        <h2>What is Interest Rate Differential (IRD)?</h2>
        
        <p>IRD measures how much money the lender thinks they will lose when you break your mortgage early — based on their posted rates, not your discounted rate.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <div class="example-title">In simple terms</div>
            <p>IRD ≈ (your original posted rate − current posted rate for the remaining term) × remaining years × mortgage balance</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="important-note">
            <p><strong>Key issue:</strong> Banks typically use their posted (non-discounted) rates — not the rate you actually pay. That single detail is why penalties explode.</p>

                <li>Your contract (discounted) rate: 5.50%</li>
