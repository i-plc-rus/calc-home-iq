    <!-- Article Content -->
    <div class="article-content">
        <p class="lead">Legal fees in real estate are often described as "standard," "flat," or "minor." In reality, they are one of the most misunderstood parts of a real estate transaction — and a common source of frustration for buyers, sellers, and landlords across Calgary and Alberta.</p>
        
        <div class="important-note">
            <p><strong>Key insight:</strong> Legal fees are often poorly understood rather than intentionally hidden. Understanding what they cover and why they vary can prevent frustration at closing.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>What a Real Estate Lawyer Actually Does</h2>
        
        <p>A real estate lawyer's role is not just "paperwork." They are legally responsible for critical parts of your transaction that carry real liability.</p>
        
        <div class="responsibilities-grid">
            <div class="responsibility-item">Reviewing and explaining the real estate contract</div>
            <div class="responsibility-item">Ensuring clear title to the property</div>
            <div class="responsibility-item">Registering ownership and mortgage documents</div>
            <div class="responsibility-item">Handling and accounting for trust funds</div>
            <div class="responsibility-item">Managing lender instructions and conditions</div>

        </div>
        
        <div class="important-note">
            <p><strong>Liability matters:</strong> If something goes wrong, the lawyer — not the realtor — carries legal liability for these functions.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Legal Fees vs Disbursements: Understanding the Distinction</h2>
        
        <p>This is where confusion begins. Understanding this distinction is crucial to avoiding billing surprises.</p>
        
        <div class="comparison">

                <div class="comparison-label">Disbursements</div>
                <div class="comparison-value">Out-of-pocket costs the lawyer pays on your behalf. Examples include land title registration fees, title searches, courier and software fees, bank processing fees, condo document handling, and title insurance.</div>

        </div>
        
        <div class="important-note">
            <p><strong>Common misunderstanding:</strong> Many people think disbursements are "extra padding." They are not — but they are often underestimated or poorly explained.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Typical Legal Fees in Alberta</h2>
        
        <div class="important-note">

        <h2>What "Flat-Rate Legal Fees" Really Mean</h2>
        
        <p>Many Calgary law firms advertise flat-rate real estate fees. This is helpful — but only if you understand the scope of what's included.</p>
        
        <div class="includes-excludes">
            <div class="includes-list">
                <h5>A flat rate usually assumes:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>One buyer and one seller</li>
                    <li>One title</li>
                    <li>One mortgage</li>
                    <li>No unusual conditions or defects</li>
                    <li>Standard closing timeline</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="excludes-list">
                <h5>The flat rate often does NOT include:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Multiple mortgages</li>
                    <li>Private or secondary lenders</li>
                    <li>Title issues or encroachments</li>
                    <li>Power of attorney situations</li>
                    <li>Trust conditions requiring extra work</li>
                    <li>Additional properties or parking titles (condos)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="important-note">
            <p><strong>Important distinction:</strong> Flat fee ≠ capped total cost in every situation. Complexities can trigger additional legal fees.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Why Legal Fees Increase in "Non-Standard" Deals</h2>
        
        <p>Some situations require more legal work and carry more risk, such as:</p>
        
        <div class="scenario-grid">
            <div class="scenario-item">
                <strong>Condo purchases</strong>
                Multiple documents, reserve fund review
            </div>
            <div class="scenario-item">
                <strong>Estate sales</strong>
                Probate, executor authority
            </div>
            <div class="scenario-item">
                <strong>Rentals with tenants</strong>
                Tenancy agreements, notices
            </div>
            <div class="scenario-item">
                <strong>Private mortgages</strong>
                Alternative lender requirements
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="important-note">
            <p><strong>Understanding higher costs:</strong> In these cases, higher fees usually reflect real work and real liability, not padding. More complex transactions require more review, more documentation, and carry higher professional risk.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Buying vs Selling: Key Fee Differences</h2>
        
        <div class="buy-sell-comparison">
            <div class="buy-box">
                <h3>Buyers Pay More Overall</h3>
                <p>Buyers typically pay more because lawyers must:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Review lender instructions carefully</li>
                    <li>Register the mortgage on title</li>
                    <li>Coordinate funds from multiple sources</li>
                    <li>Verify title and tax adjustments</li>
                    <li>Handle more conditions overall</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="sell-box">
                <h3>Sellers Pay Slightly Less</h3>
                <p>Sellers typically pay less because:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>No mortgage is being registered</li>
                    <li>Fewer lender instructions to manage</li>
                    <li>Fewer conditions overall</li>
                    <li>Less coordination of incoming funds</li>
                    <li>Generally simpler title work</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="important-note">
            <p><strong>Setting expectations:</strong> Understanding this natural cost difference helps set fair expectations when comparing quotes or discussing fees with your lawyer.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>The Most Common Surprises Clients Face</h2>
        
        <div class="surprises-list">
            <div class="surprise-item">"I thought that was included in the flat fee"</div>
            <div class="surprise-item">"No one mentioned extra title costs for the condo"</div>
            <div class="surprise-item">"Why are there bank fees from the lender?"</div>
            <div class="surprise-item">"Why is refinancing almost as expensive as buying?"</div>
            <div class="surprise-item">"What are these 'disbursement' charges I wasn't expecting?"</div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="important-note">
            <p><strong>The root cause:</strong> Almost always, these surprises come from not reviewing the fee letter carefully or not asking enough questions about what's included and what's not.</p>
        </div>

            <p><strong>Legal fees are risk insurance, not just a service charge.</strong></p>

                <li>What situations increase the cost?</li>
