      <p>Choosing a realtor in Calgary is one of the most financially important decisions you'll make — and one of the most confusing.</p>
      <p>There are thousands of licensed realtors in Calgary. Most use similar language. Most promise "great service." Very few explain how they actually work, how they're paid, or how much risk sits with you.</p>
      <p>This guide shows you how to choose the right realtor for your situation, step by step — without ranking, promoting, or selling anyone.</p>

      <div class="guide-section">
        <h2>First: What a Realtor Actually Does (and What They Don't)</h2>
        
        <div class="step-card">
          <h3>A realtor's core role is to:</h3>
          <ul class="do-list">
            <li>Represent your interests in a transaction</li>
            <li>Advise on pricing, strategy, and negotiation</li>
            <li>Handle paperwork, deadlines, and conditions</li>
            <li>Coordinate with lawyers, lenders, inspectors, and appraisers</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="warning-box">
          <h3>A realtor is NOT:</h3>
          <ul class="dont-list">
            <li>A home inspector</li>
            <li>A mortgage broker</li>
            <li>A renovation advisor</li>
            <li>A trades or contractor manager</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="warning-note">Understanding this boundary is critical — and explains why many realtors hesitate to "recommend" other services after closing.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Step 1: Be clear about your situation -->
      <div class="guide-section">
        <h2>Step 1: Be Clear About Your Situation First</h2>
        <p>Before you interview any realtor, know which category you're in:</p>
        
        <div class="step-card">
          <h3>Buyers</h3>
          <ul class="do-list">
            <li>First-time buyer</li>
            <li>Move-up buyer</li>
            <li>Investor / rental buyer</li>
            <li>Relocating to Calgary</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3 class="sub-section-title">Sellers</h3>
          <ul class="do-list">
            <li>Primary residence</li>
            <li>Rental or tenant-occupied property</li>
            <li>Estate sale</li>
            <li>Time-sensitive sale (job move, divorce, financial pressure)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        
        <p><strong>Different situations require different realtor skill sets.</strong> A "great" realtor for a first-time buyer may be a terrible fit for an investor — and vice versa.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Step 2: Look for local depth -->
      <div class="guide-section">
        <h2>Step 2: Look for Local Depth, Not Flashy Marketing</h2>
        <p><strong>Marketing looks impressive. Local knowledge makes you money.</strong></p>
        <p>When evaluating a Calgary realtor, ask about:</p>
        
        <div class="success-box">
          <ul class="do-list">
            <li>Communities they work in most often</li>
            <li>Typical home age and construction in those areas</li>
            <li>Pricing adjustments between similar streets</li>
            <li>Common inspection issues in local housing stock</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        
        <p>A realtor deeply familiar with specific Calgary communities will help you avoid mistakes a generalist won't even see.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Step 3: Ask the questions most people skip -->
      <div class="guide-section">
        <h2>Step 3: Ask the Questions Most People Skip (But Shouldn't)</h2>
        <p>These questions separate professionals from promoters:</p>
        
        <div class="question-card">
          <h4>1. "How do you price a home — exactly?"</h4>
          <p><strong>Listen for:</strong></p>
          <ul class="do-list">
            <li>Comparable selection logic</li>
            <li>Adjustment reasoning (lot size, basement type, upgrades)</li>
            <li>Strategy when the market shifts</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="risk-note">Vague answers = risk.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question-card">
          <h4>2. "How do you handle competitive or slow markets?"</h4>
          <p><strong>Good answers explain:</strong></p>
          <ul class="do-list">
            <li>Offer strategy</li>
            <li>Timing decisions</li>
            <li>Price change thresholds</li>
            <li>Data, not guesses</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question-card">
          <h4>3. "Who do you work with — and who do you avoid recommending?"</h4>
          <p>This is important. Most experienced realtors avoid recommending trades and contractors because:</p>
          <ul class="dont-list">
            <li>They don't control the work</li>
            <li>They don't want liability</li>
            <li>One bad referral can damage their reputation</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="normal-note">This is normal — and smart. What matters is whether they:</p>
          <ul class="do-list">
            <li>Acknowledge this clearly</li>
            <li>Offer safe alternatives (guides, checklists, independent resources)</li>
          </ul>

      </div>

      <!-- Step 4: Understand how your realtor is paid -->
      <div class="guide-section">
        <h2>Step 4: Understand How Your Realtor is Paid</h2>
        <p><strong>Commission structure matters less than alignment.</strong></p>
        
        <div class="success-box">
          <h3>Key questions:</h3>
          <ul class="do-list">
            <li>Are there minimum commissions?</li>
            <li>Are incentives tied to speed vs. price?</li>
            <li>How are cooperating commissions handled?</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        
        <p>A good realtor should explain compensation openly and without defensiveness.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Step 5: Judge communication style -->
      <div class="guide-section">
        <h2>Step 5: Judge Communication Style — Not Personality</h2>
        <p><strong>You're hiring a service provider, not a friend.</strong></p>
        
        <div class="step-card">
          <h3>Look for:</h3>
          <ul class="do-list">
            <li>Clear explanations in plain English</li>
            <li>Willingness to explain pros and cons</li>
            <li>Responsiveness during low-stakes conversations (that predicts high-stakes ones)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        
        <p>If communication feels rushed or fuzzy now, it will be worse under pressure.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="guide-section">
        <h2>Step 6: Red Flags Most People Ignore</h2>
        
        <div class="warning-box">

            <li>"You don't need an inspection here"</li>
